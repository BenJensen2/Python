// You have a 3 and a 5 gallon water container. Each container has no markings except for text displaying 
// its total volume. You havea  running tap, and must use the containers and tap in such a way as to 
// exactly measure out 4 litres of water. How do??


// We can time the amount of seconds it takes to fill up the 3 gallon container: 
//      This will give us Gal/sec flow rate for the running tap.
// 1 gallon = 3.78541 Liters
//  convert the Gal/sec to L/sec and find out how much time it takes to get 4 liters







// You have 50 coins. 4 of them are heads up, and the rest are heads down. You cannot see them, and you cannot
// feel any difference between heads or tails. How can you split up the coins into two groups so that each 
// group of coins has the same number of heads and tails?

// Split them into 25 and 25

// Potential Outcomes:
// 1:
